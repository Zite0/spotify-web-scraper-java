# spotify-web-scraper-java
 Spotify web scraper written entirely in Java. Originally, the project was made with
 Spotify using Django for the web interface. However, Python proved to be quite cumbersome
 to work with. The main reason I chose to migrate to Java is that a concurrent implementation
 of our functions is much smoother than in Python, as threading was almost impossible to implement
 and even had a worse performance than the sequential implementation.
